The advantages and disadvantages of the 3 implementations are as follows:

fibonacci1:(Recursive)
Advantage: Easy to understand and maintain.
Disadvantage: Inefficient for large values of n

fibonacci2:(Memoization)
Advantage: The most efficient implementation for all values of n.
Disadvantage: Slightly more difficult to understand and maintain.

fibonacci3:(Iterative)
Advantage: More efficient than recursive implementation for large values of n and save memory allocation than Memoization.
Disadvantage: Slightly more difficult to understand and maintain and more complex.
